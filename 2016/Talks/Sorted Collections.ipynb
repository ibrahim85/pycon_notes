    "__Note from Raphael__: I had a long hallway conversation with Raymond Hettinger (Python core dev... author of `Collections` module) about this talk, and I extracted some points that should be added here:\n",
    "\n",
    "* There is no singular sorted collection implementation that is optimal for all use cases\n",
    "  * e.g. Mostly reading vs Mostly writing\n",
    "* Some methods exposed in the `SortedContainer` package (like `bisect`) are just forwarding along implementation details, and probably don't belong in the public API.\n",
    "  * the usage of these should probably be avoided in most cases\n",
    "  * The reasoning here, is that by exposing these things you encourage a pattern of usage that strays from the purpose of the package/module/class/etc\n",
    "* There's some violation here of the original concepts behind the original types that have \"sorted\" counterparts here\n",
    "  * For instance, a `set` doesn't really have any business being sorted\n",
    "    * `sets` are designed for removing duplicates, and quick membership tests\n",
    "* the impressive performance, and testimonials presented about `SortedContainers` will probably lead to a call to add this to the stdlib. There's some interesting reasons why this isn't straightforward:\n",
    "  * Python doesn't want to be opinionated, especially when there are different optimal ways do to things depending on the use case\n",
    "    * the preferred route is to provide powerful building blocks to make these things possible\n",
    "      * e.g.: requests is better off outside of stdlib\n",
    "  * The API this package exposes (in its current form) promotes some less than ideal usages\n",
    "    * generally, this leads to feature requests, bugs, etc that seek to optimize these cases, while degrading the actual intended case\n",
    "    * For example: if you added a numeric index to *all* dictionaries, people who aren't even using that functionality have to deal with the added memory consumption for no added benefit\n",
    "  * This is probably going to launch a big \"war\" about adding `SortedCollections` to the stdlib, and it will be interesting to watch the drama unfold\n",
    "    * grab your popcorn\n",
